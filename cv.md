## Code example:

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

    HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
    MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
    SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

```
function humanReadable (seconds) {

  let h = Math.floor(seconds / 3600)

  let m = Math.floor((seconds - h*3600)/60)

  let s = seconds - h*3600 - m*60;

  return `${Math.trunc(h/10)}${h%10}:${Math.trunc(m/10)}${m%10}:${Math.trunc(s/10)}${s%10}`;

}
```
